# Sublime Commands

Sublime Text's command pallet misses most of the internal commands exposed by the main menu.

Packages like [Missing Commands](https://github.com/fjl/Sublime-Missing-Palette-Commands) therefore provide all commands not located in Sublime Text's _Default_ package.

This package provides a merged and hopefully complete Default.sublime-commands which is intended to be placed into the _Default_ package.

If you want to use it to override ST's commands you'll need to clone this repo into Sublime Text's _Packages_ path as _Default_
